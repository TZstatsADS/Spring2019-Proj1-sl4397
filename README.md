This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2019

+ Projec title: Happiness Moments & Marriage
+ This project is conducted by Shuang Lu (sl4397)

+ Project summary: In this projects, I explore whether marriage alters people's definition of happiness by comparing the distributions of happy moments of two group of people: single and married. I further divide the population according to gender, country and age to see how marriage affects different groups of people's definition of happiness differently.
